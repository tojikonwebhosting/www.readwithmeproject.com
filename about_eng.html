							to acquire and develop their reading skills through school and library activities and close cooperation with parents to support this goal.</li>
							<li>In order to provide educational institutions with age-appropriate children's literature for their primary school students,
							the Read Together Project distributed a total of 57,110 books to 435 schools. Of these, 47,382 books were distributed in Tajik
							and 9,728 books in Russian. All non-Russian language schools received a set of children's literature in Russian (19 items).</li>
							<li>720 books were distributed to 3 summer camps in the region.</li>

							regional branches of the Institute of Advanced Training and Retraining of Education, pedagogical universities and schools of the
							region as national and regional trainers of the program.</li>
