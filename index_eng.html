						 Dictionary is a word. By word, we mean the word's relation to the world of objects, events, processes, and so on. When people say a word, they first of all pay attention to its meaning. The more vocabulary a person knows, the clearer he can speak, and the better he can understand books, works, and the words of others. Vocabulary is an integral part of the competencies of listening, speaking, reading and writing, and is the main linguistic element of young schoolchildren. The teacher's verbal descriptions or exercises do not contribute to the vocabulary and enrichment of the vocabulary. The new dictionary should be used regularly and repeatedly in a variety of situations: speaking, listening, and writing. This allows students to memorize and use words, teachers practice different ways of teaching vocabulary with students, including how to use different dictionaries and cultures, develop glossaries, crossword puzzles, group words by features, and write sentences. given with words, various educational games and others.

						 Our speech is made up of words. When we speak, we mean, first of all, the words through which people exchange ideas. From time immemorial, words with their characteristics have attracted the attention of the public, unlike most scientists. The word can make a person both happy and upset, it can encourage or, conversely, it can discourage and disappoint. This is no coincidence because the word has amazing qualities. Such features of the word sometimes seem miraculous, but there is no miracle here: the word is the product of a long relationship between people and the result of their society. The teacher is obliged to give the knowledge to the students from the scientifically correct point of view, so that their knowledge is not non-scientific formal and superficial. Its application reveals to readers an objective connection and a two-way relationship between the events being studied.
